# freeCodeCamp Back End Development and APIs
In the Back End Development and APIs, you'll learn how to write back end apps with Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager). You'll also build web applications with the Express framework, and build a People Finder microservice with MongoDB and the Mongoose library.<br />
Above are the exercises that I took a little time to help you get the certificate.<br />
